### Critical-Mass---Development-Intern

## Work / Project Examples

Provide up to three examples of work/projects that you've recently participated in and provide detailed information about your role and contributions to the project.

1. https://www.chosenfamilyday.ca/

Chosen Family Day - This project was called Chosen Family Day. The purpose was to recognize and celebrate the valued relationships between friends and allies in the LGBTQI2S community. I was assigned the role as the main developer, I was given the responsibility to decide the technologies to create this project in 2 weeks. Partnered in with our Senior Designer to address images/assets/typography sizing to expect an optimal level of performance when rendering/compile on the actual site. I collaborated with our teams UX Architecture to understand the flow and user experience of the designed pages.  Our client wanted a special effect headline on the landing page (wavey text). I discovered that Airbnb has a library called Lottie, which can render After Effects animations in real-time. Then I got in contact with our motion designer who created a wavey headline animation in After Effects rendering to Bodymovin. I was able to plug this JSON file into Lottie to create the effect live. We had also implemented an User Generated Content Social Media Feed through Elfsight, and this would display instagram feeds through a specific hashtag.
The technologies used to create this website; Webflow CMS, Elfsight, GoDaddy for domain.

2. https://www.hrblock.ca/tax-scenarios/us-tax-returns/

HRBLOCK - I was the developer for this specific project. With tax season approaching, HRBlock has many updates, page builds, and maintenance on their website/application. I was given this page design to build utilizing WordPress - PHP. I had no experience with WordPress, so I had to quickly get up to speed with understanding this tool. I collaborated with our team's Senior Designer and Digital Producer to understand the layout of the page and provide feedback on images/assets to optimize performance on the site. I recommended and implemented the use of images below 100kb and 1200x675 to create the best responsive experience and increased better performance measures when a client lands on the page. When building this website page, I would use HTML5/CSS3 and optimize responsive web with media queries. Manipulating the DOM was also the reason for my success in completing this page before the given project due date.
Some of the learns I had working with WordPress is that many items are built and used with specific plugins, and this limited your own creativity with styling.

3. https://github.com/mikeyqq/serverless-stack-client     &&    https://pocketlist.netlify.com/

Pocket list - I bumped into an article about cloud computing and serverless architectures that blew my mind. Amazon web services offer many technologies that help companies explore serverless experiences. I thought about how fast I could help companies save money establishing a better understanding of AWS. Other mentionable benefits of serverless computing would be eliminating server management, establish quicker deployments and app updates, and increasing the overall development experience.
During this project as the developer, I was setting up the AWS CLI that would establish the functions and services on amazon to allow serverless computing. It was literally Amazon running my API Gateway with Lambda that would allow my front end to perform CRUD with it. I had DynamoDB set up as the database and Cognito services for authentication. The coolest part is that Amazon also has S3 that would allow you to save files/images/documents to it. With the serverless services setup, I was spending more time with the front end aspect of the application and focusing on the users' experience. The front end was built was React and React Bootstrap as the UI.


## Inspiration

Provide up to three examples of work that has recently inspired you from a technical perspective. These can be open source projects, CodePens/CodeSandboxes, blog posts, etc. Be sure to include specifics on what you found inspiring.

1. https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/inspiration/

Recently on Instagram, there were many creative Augmented Reality Effects popping up, and a lot was created by Content Creators/Influencers/Avid Users. AR was always a realm that scared me because of how realistic it felt with out of the world effects. Now watching all these cool effects people with little to no coding experience were building I had to figure out how. This is when I came across SparkAR by Facebook, providing a lot of easy to follow and examples for creating different types of effect to add on your Instagram. I had a moment to myself, recognizing how advanced technologies have become and how fast we are learning and adapting to new technologies. The most inspiring part is how powerful technologies are these days that you can build an AR effect with little to no coding experience. 

2. https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/css-polaroid-camera/

This was  the coolest and inspiring project I worked on recently. As an Software Developer, you must spend equal amount of time training your basic fundamentals of HTML5/CSS3 and other languages/frameworks like Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and React.
I was seeing the world of HTML5/CSS3 through a new level working with how to recreate physical products like this polaroid camera with CSS only.
There were many notable learns that really elevated my underdstanding and levels as a coder. Planning, structuring components, understanding style and size, working with shadows, hightlights, and reflections.

3. https://medium.com/facebook-design/using-thoughtful-design-to-fight-bullying-on-instagram-d7943d7cb721

Using thoughtful designs to fight bullying and other social issues on social media. This article really hits the spot. On planet Earth, we have more mobile devices than human beings. It unimaginable how easily kids have access to the internet now and know the things they do and say. It's scary how social media apps like Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat just to name a few are the first batch of applications that people download now. What I love about this article is exploring different ways through design to tackle issues like mental health, self-harm, social comparisons, hate speech, and bullying. What inspired me the most about this article is empowering others to stop bullying when and where it happens through thoughtful design. Because we know visual design and ques can affect one's actions/emotions.



## Focus

If you were given the time and resources to build/learn anything you wanted during your internship, where would you choose to focus your efforts? Provide a brief description of how you would spend your time.

1. I would love to comfortable with the uncomfortable and tackle more on backend development. I would spend time working on understanding the fundamentals and then work on small projects and features with Python.  The reason is that Python is versatile and flexible in working with Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Big data, and Automation. 

2. It would be great to add more experience to my testing abilities. It's always important to test codes. It would be tremendously helpful to test codes and check for bugs in different projects. This will ensure that we are setting the application up for success when users are on it. 

2. It would be a great opportunity to sit in with a UI/UX Designer and be in their world for a day. Spending time with our Designers will give you a better insight into how UI/UX affects users' experience and really picking their brains on the "how" and "why".

3. It's always great to dream big and tackle the biggest problem in the world. But sometimes it's important to sharpen your skills and practicing fundamentals. I would spend time at the beginning of my internship and going over fundamentals on JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS3, CI/CD, Testing, Version Controls.
